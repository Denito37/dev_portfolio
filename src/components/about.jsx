                I started coding three years ago with Swift & Python solving 
                problems both for College & for fun. In the Spring
                semester of my sophomore year, I applied for an internship
                in which I needed to follow a guide for developing a Simon Says-like 
                rhythm game website & then I had to add features I would like to improve the game. 
                After this, it became clear to me that web development was the career that I wanted to pursue. 
                I also enjoy cooking & reading graphic novels in my free time.
